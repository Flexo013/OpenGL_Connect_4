Getting a blank screen and no clue why?
Try the following checklist:

0. Check if your OpenGL version used is >= 3.3 ( should be a line in the console of your application )

1. Check if your shaders compiled. Usally an error log will be displayed in the console of 
your application.

2. Check if your shaders are bound before drawing and setting any uniform. ( shaderprogram->bind() )

3. Check if your model really contains the data you whish to render. 
Check the length of the arrays returned by your Model.

4. Check if your buffers are setup correctly with glVertexAttribPointer(), 
especially the location parameter which should match those in the shaders.
( 0 for positions, 1 for colors and 2 for normals in the provided shaders )

5. Check if glEnableVertexAttribArray() is called in the buffer initialization for the
attribute location (0,1,2) you whish to render.

6. Check if you bound the Vertex Array object before drawing.

7. Check your transformation matrices. 
For example, create a QVector3D of known location and multiply it with your 
matrices (P * V * M * Vector) and check the outcome.
It should be somewhere between x: [-1, 1], y: [-1,1] and z [0,1] after projection. 
Try modifying your transformations if it is not within those ranges. ( translating the View for example )

8. Check if the input data from the fragment shader is available. 
Try rendering with just fColor = vec4(normalVec,1.0); to check the normals for example.
This also works on uniforms.

9. Check if culling is enabled (glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE); is called) and disable it.
