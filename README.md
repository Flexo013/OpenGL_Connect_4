# OpenGL_Connect_4
A simple game of connect 4 implemented in OpenGL.

## Instructions
Once loaded you will be presented with a connect 4 board. On the table there is one disk showing whose turn it is. 

You can use the buttons **1 through 7** to select in which column you will drop the disk on your turn. After dropping a disk it will be the other player's turn to press one of the buttons 1 through 7. 

The game ends when a player has successfully made 4 in a row or when there are no more possible moves. The game board will change color to indicate a player has won. It will become grey if the game resulted in a draw. 

You can **press 0 or R to reset the game** at any point. *(You can use this to have red make the first move.)*

*Note: If you have used any of the dials or radio buttons in the left panel, then you will need to click on the game board. This will make sure it is in focus and your button presses will be registered by the game.*
