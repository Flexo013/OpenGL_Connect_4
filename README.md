# OpenGL_Connect_4
A simple game of connect 4 implemented in OpenGL.

## Instructions
Once loaded you will be presented with a connect 4 board. On the table there is one disk showing whose turn it is. Start playing by clicking on the game board (to make sure it is in focus).

You can use the buttons **1 through 7** to select in which column you will drop the disk on your turn. After dropping a disk it will be the other player's turn to press one of the buttons 1 through 7. The game ends when a player has successfully made 4 in a row. You can **press 0 or R to reset the game**.
